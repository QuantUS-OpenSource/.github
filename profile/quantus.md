# QUANTUS – Open-Source Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) Toolkit

**QUANTUS** is a collaborative research and software initiative developed by *HybridEcho (TU Dresden)*, *UC San Diego*, and international partners.  
Its goal is to provide a **modular, reproducible, and openly available platform for Quantitative Ultrasound Analysis (QUS)** to accelerate research and clinical translation.

---

## 🔍 Motivation

Quantitative ultrasound techniques (QUS) such as BSC, ATT, SoS, Scatterer Size Imaging, or H-Scan are promising, yet currently limited by:

- proprietary or poorly documented implementations  
- inconsistent or incompatible data formats  
- limited reproducibility across labs  
- challenges in comparing results between studies

**QUANTUS** addresses these limitations by offering a **unified, validated, and open framework** for dataset import, RF signal processing, QUS parameter estimation, and visualization.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Deliver a **complete, transparent, and reproducible QUS analysis pipeline**
- Provide standardized implementations of **BSC, H-Scan, ATT, SoS**, and more
- Harmonize **data interfaces** (DICOM-US, raw RF, vendor-specific exports)
- Support **large clinical datasets** (liver, IBD, oncology, MEMS ultrasound)
- Enable **validation and multicenter comparisons**
- Facilitate clinical translation through **quality control and version tracking**

## 🧩 Architecture

QUANTUS is structured into modular components:
