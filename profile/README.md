# QUANTUS

**QUANTUS is an open, modular toolkit for Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) developed by HybridEcho (TU Dresden), UC San Diego, and international partners.**  
It provides standardized implementations for QUS algorithms, a unified data interface for RF and DICOM-US, and a shared GUI for clinical research and multicenter validation.  
The project enables reproducible QUS pipelines, harmonized analysis across sites, and rapid integration of new methods through a plugin-based architecture.
